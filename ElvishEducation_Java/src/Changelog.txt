    Today I added a new feature to allow the addition of words to the vocabulary
through the use of the application itself, easily drawing the connections between
new words and words already in the banks. This solution came with a slew of new
text files, as well as a new Java class called TextManipulation to do all of the
heavy duty reading, writing, and editing of the text files. Right now there are
21 nouns, 8 verbs, 10 adjectives, and 1 preposition in the library.
